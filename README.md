Staff are allowed on this group. Joining this group will allow you to see and edit the code that the bot in the server. The code is updated alot and will need updating. You MUST NOT use this code as your own and MUST give Bud82jp#0038 credit in the about section of the bot. You also MUST ask Bud82jp#0038 to use it. You can do this by opening a ticket in the discord server or DMing him.
If you are found to be using my code I shall take legal action. 

I do use other people's code but I will always give credit if they say I need to. 
If you have any inquries about the bot please open a ticket on the discord server and type .question and than ask your question (This is a private part of the code of the purpose of my staff members.)

If you see anything that is like the following:
{UserId}

[User Id]
(User Id)

Than you need to change that code for the bot to work with it.
